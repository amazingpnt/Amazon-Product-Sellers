Select a product on amazon and click on "Other sellers on Amazon". The extension will display the best seller based on Laplace's rule of succession. It doesnt factor in the difference in prices between sellers though.
Make sure to scroll all the way down so that all sellers are loaded into the extension.
You can click on any seller in the popup and it will take you that seller on the amazon seller page.
